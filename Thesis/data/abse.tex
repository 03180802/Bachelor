In order to achieve the automatic import of BPA data into DIgSILENT, I analyzed mathematical models in equipments in BPA and DIgSILENT, and got the two conversion formulas between device model parameters. I studied the functional and technical characteristics of DIgSILENT Python Module and summarized the work steps to convert BPA grid model into DIgSILENT. I determined the use of Python scripting language to design the programs for converting BPA grid model into DIgSILENT and developed to achieve the program. Finally, I tested the program with IEEE9 node examples and IEEE39 node examples respectively. It is proved that the program meets the design requirements.
